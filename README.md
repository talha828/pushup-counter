# pushup_counter

I'm thrilled to share my recent project where I combined AI and Flutter to develop a fascinating push-up counter app. ðŸš€
By leveraging AI techniques, the app accurately detects and tracks push-up movements in real-time using the device's camera. Users can enjoy an interactive fitness experience with personalized push-up tracking. ðŸ’¯

Excited about the possibilities AI brings to mobile app development! Stay tuned for more projects as I explore AI's potential in Flutter. ðŸŒŸ
